Formatting Guidelines
---------------------

*	Each entry should be contained as an unordered list item. The description goes here.

	All code examples should be headed with an H5:
	
	##### Code Example
	
	``` javascript
	
	var someCode;
	
	// Code examples are entered like this, with the language specified for syntax highlighting
	
	```
	
*	Another entry.
