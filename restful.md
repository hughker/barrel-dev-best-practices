Barrel Development Best Practices

API/REST Best Practices
------------------

- try to avoid using plugins (unsure if this can be a best practice, but apis change fast so it's nice to be incontrol)
- when pulling data from a third party api (ex. twitter, facebook), always have a backup for if/**when** the api fails, this could be a db to pull the last posts from, etc.
